                            1.	<b>PAPERLESS BILLING OVERVIEW.</b>  Paperless Billing is a free service of Meralco wherein a customer may opt to receive his monthly electric bills electronically instead of paper bills. The electronic copy of the bill may be accessed through a link in the bill notification sent to the customer’s enrolled primary email address, or directly through the customer’s Meralco Online account. This billing facility is subject to ERC’s Rules on Electronic Billing and Communications for Electricity Consumers. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            2.	<b>MERALCO Online Account.</b>  Prior to subscription to Paperless Billing, enrolment in the Meralco Online account, which is free of charge, is required, subject to compliance with the requirements of Meralco Online enrollment. Enrollment in Meralco Online shall require a Service Identification Number (SIN). The customer will be required to nominate a password to ensure the security of the information within the Meralco Online account. This password will be used to log in to the online account and to access his electronic bill.
                            <br/><br/>
                            3.	<b>MERALCO ACCOUNT SUBSCRIPTION TO PAPERLESS BILLING.</b> Only the account holder (registered customer or actual user), with all SINs associated with him, enrolled in Meralco Online is eligible for subscription to Paperless Billing.  If new SINs are associated with the account holder after subscription to Paperless Billing, these new SINs shall automatically be subscribed to Paperless Billing. If SINs are disassociated from the account holder, they will automatically be unsubscribed from Paperless Billing. All Paperless Billing applications are subject to validation and internal processing. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            4.	<b>CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.</b> If the customer intending to subscribe to Paperless Billing is not the registered customer but has been previously named as the person authorized to receive the bill and whose name currently appears on the paper bill, subscription to Paperless Billing and all activities related thereto shall be subject to the following representation and warranties: (a) The customer represents and warrants that he has all rights and permissions necessary to provide Meralco with information in connection with subscription to Paperless Billing and all activities related thereto; and (b) The customer represents and warrants that he has obtained consent and authorization from the registered customer to subscribe to Paperless Billing or to cancel his subscription thereof. The customer further agrees that Meralco reserves the right to cancel his subscription to Paperless Billing at any time in order to protect its contract with the registered customer, with no liability on the part of Meralco.
                            <br/><br/>
                            5.	<b>ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC BILLS.</b> The customer will automatically receive his bill notifications via email. Thus, he is required to provide a current and valid email address which will be used by Meralco for sending bill notifications. A back-up or secondary email address may also be provided. The customer will receive emails with a link to a copy of his monthly bill. Access to the link is password-protected – the customer needs to input his Meralco Online account password when accessing electronic bills.   
                            <br/><br/>
                            6.	<b>CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS. </b> It shall be the responsibility of the customer to:
